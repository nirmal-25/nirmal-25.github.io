<!-- Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my freshman year at [Birla Institute Of Technology,  Mesra](https://www.bitmesra.ac.in/) where I completed my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering (2016-2020) with [86.3% aggregate](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4UBPBP0mvWZLRdkF_EcpmKKGp7_OA8U/view?usp=sharing).

I'm currently working as a developer for **Bell Canada** in the Amdocs Digital Delivery unit. My responsibilty includes Java/Spring based microservices development & testing. 

I'm also an [Innovation Agent](https://drive.google.com/file/d/117KS9QnDrcg7dllcAzGz_b7qQPgR3pGs/view?usp=sharing) fostering the culture of creativity and innovation at Amdocs, India.

I have been awarded as Winner in [Innovation Nugget](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1PzTZkXlQV9ldZxqmBbbO94uIqrhSwvcq/view?usp=sharing), Creativity Jam, [Design Thinking Hackathon](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1hXCATvKwzHCvctHtElsqFg5YIqabz22O/view?usp=sharing) and Runners-Up in [Project ICE Fair](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1exB19OoQ5dzU2mg4qbdkNutA25TGBWV3/view?usp=sharing) by Amdocs.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with! -->

Welcome to my portfolio! I have a primary background and strong academic experience in computer vision and machine learning.

I wish to further develop my skills by working closely on industry-focussed projects, and becoming part of a team that helps build meaningful systems using data. Keep scrolling to learn more about me!

<!-- and the one thing where even state-of-the-art models fail essentially boils down to is data. Without clean data, there is simply no learning, and I'm trying to focus more on data pre-processing techniques on one hand while also working closely with ML/DL algorithms as part of my research at Virginia Tech.  -->

Here are some of my technical skills:
